## Introduction
This is a command-line implementation of the classic Minesweeper game written in Python.

## How to Play
1. Run the `minesweeper.py` file using Python.
2. Specify the dimensions of the game board and the number of bombs when prompted.
3. Enter coordinates to dig, following the format `row,col`.
4. Continue digging until all safe cells are uncovered or until a bomb is detonated.
5. If all safe cells are uncovered, you win! Otherwise, the game ends, and you can see the locations of all bombs on the board.
